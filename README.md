# Skylink

Skylink, a futuristic airborne logistics network, is tasked with optimizing its passenger transit routes between floating cities.
Each floating city has a limited landing bay capacity, restricting the number of passengers it can receive per day. Need to compute the maximum number 
of passengers that can be transported per day from the primary hub to all final arrival points, ensuring that no relay exceeds its quota.
